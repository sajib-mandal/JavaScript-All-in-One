# Strings

There are several built-in string methods that allow you to manipulate and perform operations on strings. Here are some commonly used string methods:

1. `charAt(index)`: Returns the character at the specified index in a string.
```javascript
const str = 'Hello';
console.log(str.charAt(0)); // Output: "H"
```
